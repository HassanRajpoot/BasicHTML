        <h1><b><i>DogWorld</i></b></h1>
        <p>A dog can be a wonderful addition to any home, but whether you're an experienced pet parent or a first-time adopter, it's important to keep your canine companion's health and happiness a top priority. Below are some useful tips for all dog parents.</p>
        <p>And remember: If you're considering bringing home a new dog, please make adoption your first option. We encourage you to browse our directory of adoptable dogs in your area or visit our Find a Shelter page to start your search.</p>
        <h1 style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Feeding</b></h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Puppies eight to 12 weeks old need four meals a day.</li>
            <li>Feed puppies three to six months old three meals a day.</li>
            <li>Feed puppies six months to one year two meals a day.</li>
            <li>When your dog reaches his first birthday, one meal a day is usually enough.</li>
            <li>For some dogs, including larger canines or those prone to bloat, it's better to feed two smaller meals.</li>

        <h1>Exercise</h1>
        <p>Dogs need exercise to burn calories, stimulate their minds, and stay healthy. Individual exercise needs vary based on breed or breed mix, sex, age and level of health. Exercise also tends to help dogs avoid boredom, which can lead to destructive behaviors. Supervised fun and games will satisfy many of your pet's instinctual urges to dig, herd, chew, retrieve and chase</p>
        <h1>Grooming</h1>
        <p>Help keep your dog clean and reduce shedding with frequent brushing. Check for fleas and ticks daily during warm weather. Most dogs don't need to be bathed more than a few times a year. Before bathing, comb or cut out all mats from the coat. Carefully rinse all soap out of the coat, or the dirt will stick to soap residue. Please visit our Dog Grooming Tips page for more information.</p>
        <h1>Handling</h1>
        <p>To carry a puppy or small dog, place one hand under the dog's chest, with either your forearm or other hand supporting the hind legs and rump. Never attempt to lift or grab your puppy or small dog by the forelegs, tail or back of the neck. If you do have to lift a large dog, lift from the underside, supporting his chest with one arm and his rear end with the other.</p>
